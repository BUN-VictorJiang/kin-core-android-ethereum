# Contributing to kin-sdk-core-android

Thank you very much for helping out with this project!
Please read the following guidelines before making proposals:

## Guidelines

* All suggestions should be raised as an issue or a pull request.
* To submit your pull request, fork the repository, add your commit and submit a pull request to our `dev` branch.
* Git commit messages should include a short title and a summary explaining the issue and how it has been handled.
[Here is a handy guide on writing good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Please adhere to existing code style. We use the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
to style our code with the only exception of allowing a column limit of 120 instead of 100.
* The project includes a copy of the [Google Java style guide for IntelliJ](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
under the [.idea](.idea) folder. To format your code using the style guide on Android Studio, simply go to `Code -> Reformat Code`

**We look forward to your contributions!**
